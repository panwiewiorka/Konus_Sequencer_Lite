# Konus Sequencer Lite

This is a demo version of a currently developing fully-featured 16-channel polyphonic MIDI sequencer.

- It has a fixed length of 1 bar, 
- 16 slots for saving / loading patterns, 
- Solo / mute functionality,
- Live quantized or unquantized recording via channel pads or keyboard,
- Ability to quantize previously unquantized notes,
- Live erasing, easy clearing of channels,
- Beat-repeat MIDI-effect,
- Step-sequencer editing.

You can use the app to control any MIDI-capable synthesizers - from apps on your phone, to DAWs on computer via USB, to any hardware MIDI-synthesizers via USB-to-MIDI converters.
To use it with computer you need to choose MIDI in phone's USB settings upon connection (on most devices).\
The app uses external library [ktmidi](https://github.com/atsushieno/ktmidi) for MIDI-related operations like scanning for MIDI-ports and sending notes information.
If MIDI-port doesn't show/work, please restart the app.
Tablet layout yet to be implemented.
